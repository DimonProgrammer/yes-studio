# Yes Studio — Brand Identity & Website Redesign

## Project Overview

Redesign of brand identity and website for Yes Studio — premium webcam model agency with offices in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don. The current site ranks top in Yandex/Google organic search; redesign must preserve SEO while upgrading visuals and adding conversion-focused marketing blocks.

**Core challenge:** Balance premium positioning with approachable feel — avoid scaring off target audience with "too luxury" aesthetics.

## Target Audience

- **Primary:** Women 18-28 seeking remote high-income work
- **Psychographics:** Visually literate, value authenticity over polish, active on Instagram/TikTok/Telegram
- **Key fears:** "I won't be good enough," "It's not for me," "I'll get scammed"
- **Key desires:** Financial independence, flexible schedule, support system

## Brand Directions (Current Sprint)

### Variant A: "Bold Statement"
- **Palette:** Deep Forest #1A3C34 + Electric Pink #E84B8A + Cream #FDF8F3
- **Fonts:** Clash Display (headings) + Space Grotesk (body)
- **Logo:** Geometric Y mark + bold sans-serif with italic accent
- **Mood:** Energy, ambition, modernity

### Variant B: "Warm Confidence"
- **Palette:** Warm Terracotta #C4725B + Soft Cream #FAF6F1 + Deep Espresso #3D2C29
- **Fonts:** Fraunces/Zodiak (headings) + Satoshi (body)
- **Logo:** Organic flowing Y mark + modern sans-serif
- **Mood:** Warmth, trust, support

## Design Guidelines

### Typography Rules
- Headings: Always use brand serif/display font
- Body: Always use brand sans-serif
- Never mix more than 2 font families per layout
- Russian text: Ensure Cyrillic support for all fonts

### Color Usage
- Primary accent: Use for CTAs, key elements (max 20% of layout)
- Secondary: Supporting elements, backgrounds
- Neutral: Text, large background areas
- Never use pure black (#000000) — use brand dark color instead

### Image Style
- Lifestyle photography, not stock photos
- Natural lighting, authentic poses
- Color-graded to match brand palette
- No overly revealing content — focus on lifestyle, not explicit

## Prompting Best Practices

When generating with AI tools:
- Always specify exact HEX colors
- Include "vector style, flat, no gradients" for logos
- Mention "works at small sizes" for marks/icons
- Use English for prompts (better results)
- Generate 3-5 variants, then refine best one

## SEO Constraints

**DO NOT change without SEO review:**
- Page URLs and structure
- H1 headings text content
- Meta titles/descriptions
- Core body text on landing pages

**CAN enhance:**
- Visual styling
- Additional marketing blocks
- New blog content
- Social proof sections

## Marketing Blocks to Add

1. **Achievement counters** — "500+ models," "7 years," "₽50M+ paid"
2. **Model testimonials** — carousel with photo, name, quote, tenure
3. **Success stories** — 2-3 case studies with numbers
4. **Platform logos** — which platforms they work with
5. **FAQ section** — expanded Q&A block
6. **Income calculator** — interactive element (optional)
7. **Guarantees block** — icons with key benefits

## Current Phase
